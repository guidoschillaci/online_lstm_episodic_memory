This repository contains the code that has been used in an experiment on training a LSTM network in an online fashion using an episodic memory system. Different strategies for updating the episodic memory systems are being tested, including one that assigns to memory elements a value that depends on the expected learning progress that this item will produce in a subsequent fit.
